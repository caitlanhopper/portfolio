                    <p> Part of this waste comes from people making poor buying choices and not being aware of what

                        exists in their overfilled wardrobes.

            <h2>THE OUTCOME</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <img src="images/final-solution.jpg" alt="final solution figma wardobe image and participant closet">
                <div>
                    <p>The final solution was a closet curation app to help women choose seasonal capsule wardrobes
                        around a
                        limited colour palette. They are able to use the app to create numerous outfit combinations.
                        The app
                        aims to reduce waste by showing users that there are many outfit combination opportunities
                        and
                        encourages them to keep their clothing in circulation for longer.
                    </p>

                    <p>I chose the colour palette for the app by researching aesthetically pleasing wardrobe
                        collections on
                        Instagram. I looked at what sort of colours were being consistently presented by lifestyle
                        influencers in the 30 to 40 age bracket</p>
                    <p>I felt that a very simple, paired back colour palette would be calming and create a feel of
                        high end
                        comfort</p>
                    <p>Buttons were styled with square photos that had clearly been carefully framed. This was meant
                        to
                        increase the feel that the app would be something used by influencers and to accentuate the
                        feeling
                        that all content had been curated</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <P>This project was completed in a very limited time frame (a single weekend) and so the design
                process
                was greatly condensed. In an ideal scenario my process would include:
            </P>
            <div class="project-in-depth">
                <ul>
                    <li>More User Research: In person or Zoom observations so that I could ask users clarifying
                        questions around their storage and purchasing decisions in the moment.</li>
                    <li>More Iterations / Ideation: I would normally spend more time ideating using processes
                        such as
                        Crazy Eights, storyboarding and more lo-fi prototypes that I would ask for user feedback
                        on.
                    </li>
                    <li>User Testing and Stakeholder Feedback: Iâ€™d like to surface my assumptions by conducting more
                        user testing and consulting with stakeholders, such as devs, throughout the design process
                        to
                        test for feasibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Collaboration: UX Design and Research are both collaborative processes. Normally Iâ€™d like to
                        bounce ideas off a diverse team of users, stakeholders and designers to ensure we are
                        creating a
                        product that really solves a problem for users, is human centred and that is fully
                        functional as
                        well as aesthetically pleasing.
                    </li>
