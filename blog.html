                    <p>This report explores the fibre stage of the denim life cycle as this stage is the foundation from
                        which the principles of a circular economy as it relates to denim are built upon. The
                        principles; design out waste pollution, keep products and materials in use, regenerate natural
                        systems are all explored in relation to cotton's environmental impact throughout the report.</p>

                <div>
                    <p> I’ve been picking up on subtle digs and side comments about the working relationships between
                        designers and developers. It’s been in published online classes from reputable sources and
                        mentioned in articles I’ve read. It seemed that the stereotype of a designer changing things on
                        a whim and developers being unwilling to implement changes is pretty ingrained. Could this
                        stereotype have simply arisen due to a breakdown in communication?</p>

                <div>
                    <p>When Australia went into lockdown a few months ago and my university course went fully online I
                        thought my world was about to drastically shrink and that my learning opportunities would be
                        severely limited.</p>
                    <p>Instead I’ve had access to far more learning opportunities than would have been physically
                        possible prior to lockdown and more opportunities to network then I could have imagined.</p>
