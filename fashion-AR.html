            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <div>
                    <p>Through the subject Fashion Sustainability at QUT we were given the brief “collaboratively
                        develop a project designed to raise awareness of a key sustainability issue in order to support
                        more sustainable practices of production and consumption within the fashion system.”</p>
                    <p>I had the opportunity to collaborate with Fashion Design students Ula Francis and Millie O’Hara
                        who both shared my enthusiasm for slow fashion practices. We were keen to examine how we could
                        change consumption practices and extend the use phase of an item within the fashion system.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through interviews and field research we discovered there’s a growing interest in mending and
                        visible mending however many people lack the skills or design vision to attempt a mending
                        project. We decided to attempt to address this skill and vision deficit.</p>

        <section id="the-process-fashionAR">
            <h2>The Process:</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <div>
                    <p>I was able to facilitate some of our group work using technology and skills I’ve developed whilst
                        studying Interaction Design. We collated all our findings and class work using Miro. We also
                        used Miro to be able to collaborate and brainstorm remotely during group work sessions. This
                        enabled us to all share ideas at the same time to be able to avoid groupthink. It also allowed
                        for a democratic design process as we could quickly vote on concepts.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/fashion-sustainability-miro.png"
                    alt="screen grab of miro board showing project overview">
                <p>We followed the IDEO Design Thinking process from Empathise through to Prototype. Our process in the
                    empathise stage was very research heavy, much to my delight. After some initial brainstorming around
                    what type of issues we might like to tackle we developed a research plan. Our plan consisted of a
                    mix of literature reviews, field studies and interviews.</p>
                <img src="images/practice-studio-observations.png" alt="observations of Practice Studio">
                <p>Our field studies involved visiting local businesses and locations that we felt people with
                    progressive environmental and fashion views might visit. Through a mix of photographs, annotation,
                    observation and sketching we were able to document what sort of age demographics were visiting these
                    locations and how they interacted with the space whilst there. We also made observations around
                    attire and aesthetics to see if we could determine any attitudes towards fashion and sustainability.

                    alt="miro board containing written and photographic observations of Northey Street Farm">
                <p>From these observations we developed a problem statement: How might we enable activists to access
                    slow fashion skills to extend the life of their clothes?</p>
                <img src="images/Steve.png" alt="illustrated proto persona of a person called Steve">
                <p>We used our research to help us develop a stakeholder map, proto-personas and to create a systems map
                    of protest/slogan shirts. The systems map particularly helped us in identifying potential for
                    extending garment life that might be of interest to people with pro environmental attitudes.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>After much ideation we settled on an interactive zine combined with augmented reality. Our goal
                        was to have a zine that detailed the how to and why aspects of visible mending whilst the
                        augmented reality worked as a tool to help people visualise possible mends they could make to
                        their clothes.</p>
                    <p>We initially discussed using Adobe Publisher to prototype our zine however we felt limited by the
                        lack of collaboration this afforded. I was able to introduce my team to Figma so that we could
                        collaborate in real time and make design decisions together. Although typically used for UI it
                        worked exceptionally well for designing print media and had a very low barrier to entry in terms
                        of learning the tools.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/figma_zine.png" alt="zine being edited in Figma">
                <p>I also used SparkAR to create an augmented reality prototype experience of interacting with visible
                    mending. We digitised an existing iron on patch using Blender to create a 3D object that could be
                    digitally positioned using SparkAR.

                    <div>
                        <p>The Fashion Activist Toolkit; a multimedia approach to disseminate the skills required to
                            mend and customise clothing. The toolkit would be presented as a physical zine (which can
                            also be accessed digitally through WePresent and would be promoted as a digital download on
                            social media ) to a pro-environmental activist audience as another form of activism that
                            actively disrupts existing fashion consumption practices.</p>

                        <p>The zine borrows on traditional zine practices with a strong DIY aesthetic and would cover
                            topics including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How slow fashion disrupts current fashion consumption models.</li>
                            <li>Techniques for mending existing garments.</li>
                            <li>Techniques for customising clothing (with a particular focus on customisation to convey
                                pro environmental messaging).</li>
                            <li>Encouragement and steps to host mending workshops.</li>
                            <li>Empowerment to share the skills and knowledge of mending between people who know these
                                skills and those that don’t.
                            </li>
                            <li>How the ways in which we dress can be a form of quiet activism.</li>

                    <div>
                        <p>Where it deviates from traditional zines however, is that throughout the zine there will be
                            embedded opportunities to extend the content using augmented reality. </p>
                        <p>The augmented reality experience would aid in the teaching of mending and customization
                            skills and would also enable our target audience to visualise their makes and customisations
                            before committing to them. We hope that the augmented reality experience might also further
                            encourage acts of fashion and digital activism.</p>

            <!-- Reflection -->
            <section id="reflection-fashionAR">
                <h2>Reflection:</h2>
                <p>The intersection of fashion and technology is definitely my passion as a fashion futurist. Having the
                    opportunity to work in the role of a technologist and UX researcher collaborating with fashion
                    designers has shown me how creative and beneficial this collaboration can be.</p>
                <p>I've learnt the importance of sharing knowledge around tools and not assuming that everyone in every
                    stream of design is aware of all the same tools. Also of being open to new ways of doing things and
                    that we can learn so much from other design fields.</p>
                <p>I feel there is a lot of potential for technology to disrupt existing fashion systems and to
                    hopefully reshape them into a more sustainable and ethical system. Fashion has always been forward
                    focused in its vision however production and consumption are still heavily favouring a take, make,
                    waste model.
                </p>
                <p>User Research has also always featured heavily in the form of trend forecasting, such as the work
                    carried out by WGSN. I feel that by extending research practices beyond trend forecasting and
                    perhaps taking an exploratory/generative UX research approach we may be able to create and discover
                    many innovative solutions to some of the industries most complex problems.</p>
