                    <p>The FUEL Entrepreneurship Program is a co-curricular program run by The Foundry at QUT.</p>
                    <p> This project is a multidisciplinary, collaborative group project designed to improve the
                        safety of individuals as they move throughout Brisbane city. Through our research we
                        discovered that many people felt uncomfortable when walking or taking public transport in
                        the city. We came across a number of stories of individuals being followed, made to feel
                        uncomfortable or witnessing violent behaviour that they felt put them in danger. </p>
                    <p> The project has given me the opportunity to practice my user experience research skills and
                        to experience project management first hand.
                    </p>

                        myself
                        have been collaborating
                        both synchronously and asynchronously through the use of Miro and Figma.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Throughout the project we have followed the IDEO Design Thinking Process:</p>
                    <ul class="process-list">
                        <li>Empathise</li>
                        <li>Define</li>

                        <li>Iterate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We began to develop empathy for people commuting through Brisbane city by conducting a survey
                        and
                        analysing the results using affinity maps.</p>
                    <p>We looked at issues surrounding safety, transport and attitudes towards autonomous vehicles
                    </p>

                <img src="images/brisbane-city-survy.png" alt=" sample of survey about Brisbane city">
                <p>Originally we had the assumption that traffic was a real issue for people moving through the
                    CBD
                    but
                    as we analysed the results using affinity maps we realised that many people were actually more
                    concerned for
                    their
                    physical safety.</p>
                <img src="images/fuel-affinity-map.png" alt="sample of one of our affinity maps">
                <p>We also used empathy maps to help us envision what our potential users might be experiencing
                    whilst
                    in the city.</p>
                <img src="images/empathy-map.png" alt="sample of pedestrian empathy map">
                <div>
                    <p>From our empathy maps we then went on to create driver and pedestrian proto personas.</p>
                    <p>Completing the proto persona for our pedestrian really highlighted for us some of the safety
                        aspects
                        that had come up in our survey.</p>

                <img src="images/pedestrian-persona.png" alt="sample of pedestrian persona">
                <p>Through this process we felt the opportunity was there to pivot and redefine our problem
                    statement.
                </p>
                <img src="images/problem-statement.png" alt="miro board redefinition of the problem statement">
                <div>
                    <p>After re-defining the problem statement we then developed a number of "how might we"
                        statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>We silently voted using "sticky dots" on the statements we felt had the most opportunity to
                        explore
                        and further develop through ideation.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/how-might-we-statements.png" alt="clusters and voting on how might we statements">
                <div>
                    <p>The ideation stage was a chance to use our skills in creativity and think as broadly as
                        possible for ways in which we could solve the issue of personal safety.</p>
                    <p>We began with a warm up by suspending disbelief and ideating without restrictions. No idea
                        was too crazy or unrealistic at this stage.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/crazy-ideas.png" alt="post it's of crazy ideas">
                <p>From there we used the SCAMPER method to create a mass of ideas by recombining and building on
                    our existing ideas and each others ideas.</p>
                <img src="images/scamper.png" alt="post its of the scamper method">
                <p>We then prioritised our ideas and grouped like ideas together. Once again we used sticky dots to
                    vote on the concepts we felt were most promising. Our ideas ranged from wearables, to workshops
                    to changing the ambience of the city</p>
                <img src="images/prioritise-solutions.png" alt="post its grouped by topic and voted on by priority">
                <p>We then used the Impact/Effort matrix to help us work out which ideas might be the most feasable
                </p>
                <img src="images/impact-effort-matrix.png" alt="post its placed on the impact effort matrix">
                <p>To help us further understand the possibilities of our most highly rated ideas on the
                    Impact/Effort matrix we used Crazy Eights to quickly sketch out possible scenarios of use. These
                    helped us to whittle down our ideas to a favourite idea from each team member.</p>
                <img src="images/crazy-eights.png" alt="hand sketched crazy eights activity">
                <div>
                    <p>These favourite ideas were further sketched and explored to create an art gallery piece</p>
                    <p>We each displayed our art gallery pieces, pitched our concepts to each other and performed a
                        round of speed critiquing, voting on aspects that we liked, offering each other feedback and
                        coming up with ideas for how each project could be further developed</p>
                    <p>We then voted a final time to decide which idea to develop further and chose to move forward
                        with designing an app.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/art-museum-speed-critique.png" alt="sketches of art mural and speed critique activity">
                <p>We then created a text based story board to ensure we were all on the same page in terms of user
                    experience and the flow/features of the app</p>
                <img src="images/storyboard-fuel.png" alt="post its storyboard">
                <p>Using Figma we were able to collaboratively create a wireframe ready for user testing</p>
                <img src="images/wireframes-fuel.png" alt="figma wireframe">
                <p>Using the wireframe we had created we were able to conduct user testing. We had a number of
                    userful discoveries in user testing which led to some UI changes and also resulted in the
                    addition of the feature to call an emergency contact.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We used the feedback from this user testing to iterate on our concept and design a higher
                        fidelity prototype in Figma</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Our final solution is the Safe Space app, designed to help people find a safe space where
                            they can step off the street if feeling uncomfortable without the expectation of having
                            to make a purchase from the establishment</p>
                        <p>Users are able to quickly find the nearest safe space, or choose a space safe they are
                            familiar with, and follow directions to find the space</p>
                        <p>The app offers users a sense of safety and comfort in a situation that has not escalated
                            enough to warrant a police call.</p>
                        <p>Upon entering the space the user is able to show a message to any staff members present
                            allerting the staff to the fact that this person needs an opportunity to get off the
                            street. We envision staff of businesses that have signed up to the program being able to
                            offer the individual reassurance, a safe space from which to check if they are being
                            followed and most importantly an opportunity to recover from the anxiety of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The app also features the ability to quickly dial emergency services and encourages users
                            to get in touch with an emergency contact such as a family member or friend if they are
                            feeling uncomfortable.</p>
                        <p>We chose a colour palette of a strong blue based on the psychology of colours. The colour
                            is supposed to encourage feelings of calm and safety. Merriweather was chosen as a font
                            for it's warmth and comforting feel.</p>

                <h2>Reflection:</h2>
                <p>I have improved my communication skills and become more aware of when I am using design jargon.
                    I've
                    also had the opportunity to facilitate a number of design exercises for my team which has led to
                    the realisation that I really enjoy facillitation and project management.</p>
                <p>I've been fascinated to see how many design activities have been able to be recreated digitally
                    through the use of Miro. It's been really great to experience working as part of a remote team
                    and
                    to practice both synchronous and asynchronous communication, similar to if we were working for a
                    fully remote company.</p>
                <p>Most importantly this project has taught me how UX Research skills apply to the real world. It's
                    been
                    exciting to learn about entrepreneurship and to see how the skills I have been learning
                    throughout
                    my degree could apply to real world problems.</p>
