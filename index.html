                <p>My perfect work day would be using the design thinking process as part of a team to ideate
                    and
                    conduct
                    user experience research. I’m currently a second year Bachelor of Design student at QUT. I'm
                    double
                    majoring in Interaction Design and Fashion Communication to work towards a job where I can
                    have
                    my dream
                    work day everyday.</p>
                <p><span>I’m currently looking for a UX internship part time during semester or full time over
                        the
                        summer, either in Brisbane or fully remote.</span></p>


                <p>Throughout my degree I’ve researched and created <a href="projects.html">projects</a> aimed
                    at
                    improving
                    Brisbane CBD, helping young adults reach Kids Helpline and encouraging high school girls to
                    consider
                    careers in STEM. I also often explore my personal interest, the intersection of technology
                    and
                    fashion.
                    I’ve prototyped apps to help people curate a slow fashion wardrobe, and prototyped a tool to
                    help
                    surface designers create visually interesting digital motifs through noise distortion using
                    JavaScript.

            <div>

                <p>I love being part of QUT’s fast paced start-up scene at The Foundry, having participated in
                    both
                    SPARK
                    and FUEL entrepreneurship programs. I also pride myself on my academic achievements having
                    recently
                    made
                    it onto the Creative Industries Dean’s List.</p>

                <p>When I’m not working with tech I’m usually nerding out over something textiles related: I
                    enjoy
                    weaving,
                    crochet and sewing my own clothes but am just as happy researching the latest textile
                    advancements.
                    I’m
                    fascinated by the fashion industry and would love to be part of helping it transition to a
                    sustainable
                    and ethical model.</p>
